Sparks Foundation Internship Project : Testing (Automated)

This project is an automated testing script for the website "https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org" using the Selenium webdriver and the Python programming language.

The script uses the unittest library to structure the tests and the HtmlTestRunner library to generate a report. Additionally, it uses the WebDriverWait and expected_conditions library to wait for elements to be clickable before interacting with them.

The test cases include checking for the presence of a logo, navigation bar, and buttons on the homepage, as well as checking that the links on the website lead to the correct URLs.

To run the script, you will need to have the Selenium webdriver and the necessary dependencies installed on your machine. You can then run the script by executing the command python filename.py.

This project is a great example of how automated testing can be used to ensure that a website is functioning properly and that links are working as expected. It also shows how Selenium can be used to automate interactions with a website and how the unittest library can be used to structure test cases.
